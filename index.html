    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      Yeoul Choi (b. 1995) is a Korean composer based in Indiana. Her music reflects a wide range of inspirations, from the beauty of nature and Korean traditions to social issues and the mysteries of life beyond death. Integrity and sincerity are central to her creative process, shaping each of her works with a distinct voice.

She earned her M.M. in Composition from the Indiana University Jacobs School of Music and her B.M. from Yonsei University. Her string trio Resistance won second prize at the JoongAng Music Concours in 2018, and she has also received awards from The Music Association of Korea Competition and the ACL-Korea New Composers’ Competition. In 2019, she co-curated The Series of Combined Music I: Baroque and Contemporary Music and released her piano solo Incognito. The following year, she produced The Series of Combined Music III: Toy Instruments, where she premiered The Toy Box for electronics and toy instruments. Her Four Piano Etudes (2022) received a prize at the Ninth New Ariel Piano Composition Competition, organized by pianist Jeffrey Jacob.

In 2024, she was awarded the ARTZenter Emerging Composer’s Grant. Her Eye of the Earth for chamber orchestra was commissioned and premiered by the San Francisco Contemporary Music Players. Her works have been performed at venues such as Ilsin Hall and Nowon Arts Center (Korea), the ACL Festival in New Zealand, the Essen Now Festival at the Essen Philharmonie (Germany), and San Francisco’s Herbst Theatre.

Choi is currently pursuing a doctoral degree in Composition at Indiana University, where she also serves as an Associate Instructor in music theory.
